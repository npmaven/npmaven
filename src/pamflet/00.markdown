# npmaven

*npmaven* is a web service for delivering [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages as Maven artifacts

Currently we have a walking skeleton running which is happily repackaging your favorite npm modules into maven-ready jars.
Just add `http://repo.npmaven.org/repo/npm` as a resolver and sepecify your dependencies as `org.maven/<npm_module_name>/<version>`.

For example, add this to your sbt project:

```scala
resolvers += "npmaven" at "http://repo.npmaven.org/repo/npm"
libraryDependencies += "org.npmaven" %  "angular" % "1.3.14" % "runtime"
```

Or this to your gradle project:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "http://repo.npmaven.org/repo/npm"
    }
}

dependencies {
    runtime "org.npmaven:angular:1.3.14"
}
```

Check it out and let us know what you think!
